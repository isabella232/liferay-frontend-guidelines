# Drag and Drop

## Drag and Drop in React

We are currently using the [react-dnd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dnd) package in [liferay-portal](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal), and we provide a shared copy as part of the [frontend-js-react-web](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/modules/apps/frontend-js/frontend-js-react-web/package.json) package.

We chose it because it powerful, flexible, and sufficiently low-level that it can be adapted to address all the use cases we've encountered so far. If you find a scenario in which it is lacking, please [open an issue](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-frontend-guidelines/issues/new/choose) in the [liferay-frontend-guidelines](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-frontend-guidelines) repo so that we can evaluate how to best meet that use case.

Some sample hits follow (but note, at the time of writing the methods used are considered to be "Legacy Decorator API" â€” react-dnd's current top-level API is based on [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) such as [`useDrag`](http://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/api/use-drag), [`useDrop`](http://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/api/use-drop) and so on):
